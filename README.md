# epidemic-modelling
This repository contains the final mini project for the NUS course SP2273: Working on Interdisciplinary Science, Pythonically. This project, titled "Enhancing Epidemic Modeling: A Dynamic Agent-Based Framework for Realistic Transmission Simulation," is a collaborative effort by me and my groupmate. Together, we developed a Python-based agent model to simulate the spread of diseases, aiming to provide a more realistic framework for epidemic modeling.

### About the Project
Our project leverages a dynamic agent-based approach, modeling interactions and transmission dynamics to mimic real-world epidemic spread. This framework can serve as a foundation for further analysis and visualization of disease propagation under various conditions. Through Pythonic methods, we applied interdisciplinary scientific and computational principles to create a tool with potential applications in public health research.
